    <p> You can find fresh curry leaves, 
        part of the citrus family, 
        in the produce aisle at Indian grocery stores, 
        health food stores, or Southeast Asian markets. 
        They're also sometimes sold frozen or dried.
        People typically eat around them or remove them if they are used whole in a recipe,
        but they can be consumed if chopped up. 
        There's really not a good substitute for curry leaves, 
        so if you don't have them, just leave them out.</p>
